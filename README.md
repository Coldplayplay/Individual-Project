Individual-Project
==================

My final year individual project, binocular 3D vision for Baxter robot.


Requires OpenCV and wxPython to be installed. OpenCV comes with the Robot Opertaing System and so this script will work if you have ROS installed. 
I used http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ to install OpenCV, wxPython-Common and wxPython on Windows (32 bit versions).

Also requires the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) which can be downloaded from http://www.vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html
