Individual-Project
==================

My final year individual project, binocular 3D vision for Baxter robot.


Requires OpenCV to be installed. OpenCV comes with the Robot Opertaing System and so this script will work if you have ROS installed. 
I used http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ to install OpenCV.

Also requires installation of python packages in "Requirements.txt"
